# Building a release

```
export NEW_VERSION="<new_version>"
git checkout -b release HEAD
jq ".version = \"$NEW_VERSION\"" package.json | sponge package.json
npm install
git commit -a -m "Bump version to $NEW_VERSION."
```

## Manual Testing

To test that a release works before creating the release we use a tarball dependency.

```
npm pack
```

### Replidraw

Check out [rocicorp/replidraw](https://github.com/rocicorp/replidraw)

Replace the replicache dependency in
[package.json](https://github.com/rocicorp/replidraw/blob/master/package.json)
with the tarball.

```
// package.json
"replicache": "file:../replicache/replicache.tar.gz",
```

Recreate the deps:

```
npm install
```

Follow instructions in repo to finish setting up app, and run to make sure it works.

### Todo Sample

Check out [rocicorp/replicache-todo](https://github.com/rocicorp/replicache-todo)

Same as Replidraw test.

### Repliear Sample

Check out [rocicorp/repliear](https://github.com/rocicorp/repliear)

Same as Replidraw test.

### Integration Guide

Walk through [the integration guide](https://doc.replicache.dev/guide/intro) and make sure things still work.

## Check for API Changes

We need to be very careful about public API changes as we then have to maintain them.

Check whether there are any public API changes by diffing `out/replicache.d.ts` between the previous released version and the new candidate. Make sure all new API has been discussed and agreed to by the team.

## Push the Release

```
git tag v<semver>
git push origin v<semver>
# update release notes on github

# note: this will push the release to the "latest" tag, which means it's what
# people will get when they `npm install`. If this is a beta release, you should
# add the `--tag=beta` flag to this command.
npm publish
```

## Release docs

The docs are built from the `docs` branch so we need to rebase that to get it
to deploy a new version.

```
git checkout docs
git pull
git reset --hard <tag-of-release>
git push origin docs
```

**Important:** Only do this when releasing a new version, otherwise we will release early docs that don't match current released code. To cherry-pick doc improvements see: "sprucing the docs", below.

**Note:** It's likely that when you `git push origin docs` above, you'll get a conflict error. This is expected if there have been any cherry-picks onto this branch as would happen if somebody "spruced" (below). Check that all the new commits on this docs branch since the last release are present in `origin/main` (note that they won't have same hash - you have to check by commit description) and if they are, then you can force the push with `git push origin docs --force`. If there is a commit on this branch which is missing from `origin/main` then somebody edited directly on this branch and it should be investigated.

# Sprucing the docs

The live docs at doc.replicache.dev are served from the `docs` channel so that they reflect the stable API.

However, this means that if you do cleanup docs changes that you want to show up immediately, you need to cherry-pick the changes onto the `docs` branch:

```
git checkout docs
git pull
git cherry-pick <hash-of-spruce-commit>
git push origin docs
```

During release, below, we reset the `docs` branch to main, dropping these cherry-picked changes. So it's important to never do work directly on `docs`.

# Performance Monitoring

We continuously track performance across a variety of benchmarks and the size of Replicache's bundle.
Results here:

- [Performance Benchmarks](https://rocicorp.github.io/replicache-internal/perf-v2/)
- [Bundle Sizes](https://rocicorp.github.io/replicache-internal/bundle-sizes)

The runner runs on an ec2 instance you can find [here](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#InstanceDetails:instanceId=i-0492542c9af59b8e7) or through the ec2 aws console. If you need
to set it up again you can kill the existing runner processes, rm the old `actions-runner` directory, and
then [follow the github instructions for installing a runner](https://github.com/rocicorp/replicache-internal/settings/actions/runners/new?arch=x64&os=linux). You will want to use `runsvc.sh install` and `runsvc.sh start` instead of `run.sh` so it
keeps running after you detach.

# Local Debugging with Source Maps

To debug and develop Replicache locally in a webpack-based app, you need to tweak a few things.

If you haven't already done so, make `replicache-internal` available to npm by using [npm-link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-link), and create a debug build.

```bash
# in your replicache-internal dir
npm link

# creates an unminified and unmangled build so that you can see symbols in the debugger/watches
npm run build -- --debug
```

In your app you want to debug, link the replicache package, and install the [`source-map-loader`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/source-map-loader) package:

```bash
cd <your replicache app, like repliear or replicache-todo>
npm link replicache

npm install -D source-map-loader
```

Modify the webpack config to include third-party source maps in its bundle.
For our sample apps (Next.js based), modify the next config:

```js
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  ...
  webpack: (config) => {
    config.module.rules.push({
      test: /\.mjs$/,
      use: ["source-map-loader"],
    });
    return config;
  },
  ...
}

```
