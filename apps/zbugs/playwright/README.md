# Running playwright tests locally

- Add ZERO_AUTH_SECRET="my-localhost-testing-secret" env
- URL="http://localhost:5174" PERCENT_DIRECT=1 npx playwright test --ui

TODO: You are supposed to be able to run in a real browser and debug by
replacing --ui with --headed, but this doesn't work for me. I get:

TypeError: Cannot redefine property: Symbol($$jest-matchers-object)
