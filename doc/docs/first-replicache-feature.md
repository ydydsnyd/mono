# My First Replicache Feature

Let's see how easy it is to add a full-stack feature using Replicache. We will add an "urgent" flag to our Todos, and the ability to toggle and persist this property.

## Modify the Model

First let's add the `urgent` boolean to the Todo model. The example app uses [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) to describe the shape of the domain objects.

```ts title="src/todo.ts"
import {z} from 'zod';
import {entitySchema, generate, Update} from '@rocicorp/rails';

export const todoSchema = entitySchema.extend({
  text: z.string(),
  completed: z.boolean(),
  sort: z.number(),

  // add this property
  urgent: z.optional(z.boolean()),
});
```

## Add a Mutator

We need to ensure that we have a mutator that can handle the new logic.

The example app already has create, update, and delete mutators generated by the [`@rocicorp/rails`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rocicorp/rails) helper library. The `updateTodo` mutator already handles any fields, so there's nothing to do here 🎉.

This pattern of reusing CRUD mutators for simple actions is common in Replicache apps — specific mutators are written to handle more specialized logic.

```ts title="src/todo.ts"
export const [createTodo, getTodo, updateTodo, deleteTodo, listTodos] =
  generate('todo', todoSchema);
```

```ts title="src/mutators.ts"
import {createTodo, updateTodo, deleteTodo} from './todo';

export const mutators = {
  createTodo,
  updateTodo,
  deleteTodo,
};
```

## Add a Toggle Button

We need to add a UI element so that the user can toggle the "urgent" flag. This is simple to do since the mutator we need is already available in this component as `onUpdate`.

```tsx title="src/components/todo-item.tsx"
<div className="view">
  ...
  {/* add this button to the view div */}
  <button
    style={{all: 'revert'}}
    onClick={() => onUpdate({id, urgent: !todo.urgent})}
  >
    !
  </button>
  ...
  <button className="destroy" onClick={() => onDelete()} />
</div>
```

At this point, we have actually finished the basic plumbing of our feature. Clicking on this button will: 1) change the state of our app (immediately), 2) persist that change, and 3) cause that change to be synchronized _in real time_ to other browsers.

## Show the "urgent" flag in the UI

Just to prove to ourselves that this is happening, let's render some text when the `urgent` flag is set:

```tsx title="src/components/todo-item.tsx"
<label onDoubleClick={handleDoubleClick}>
  {/* Add the URGENT label if urgent flag is set */}
  {todo.text} {todo.urgent && '(URGENT!)'}
</label>
```

It's not beautiful, but you get the idea. In summary, developers can often implement a feature by writing relatively simple code in one place. The data changes associated with that feature will automatically be full-stack and synchronized to other instances of the app.

Now let's [Deploy our app to production](/deploy).
