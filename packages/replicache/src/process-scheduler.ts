  /**
   * Supports scheduling a `process` to be run with certain constraints.
   *  - Process runs are never concurrent.
   *  - Multiple calls to schedule will be fulfilled by a single process
   *    run started after the call to schedule.  A call is never fulfilled by an
   *    already running process run.  This can be thought of as debouncing.
   *  - Process runs are throttled so that the process runs at most once every
   *    `throttleMs`.
   *  - Process runs try to run during an idle period, but will delay at most
   *    `idleTimeoutMs`.
   *  - Scheduled runs which have not completed when `abortSignal` is aborted
   *    will reject with an `AbortError`.
