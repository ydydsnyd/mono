  /**
   * An object used as a map to define the *mutators*. These gets registered at
   * startup of {@link Replicache}.
   *
   * *Mutators* are used to make changes to the data.
   *
   * #### Example
   *
   * The registered *mutations* are reflected on the
   * {@link Replicache.mutate | mutate} property of the {@link Replicache} instance.
   *
   * ```ts
   * const rep = new Replicache({
   *   name: 'user-id',
   *   mutators: {
   *     async createTodo(tx: WriteTransaction, args: JSONValue) {
   *       const key = `/todo/${args.id}`;
   *       if (await tx.has(key)) {
   *         throw new Error('Todo already exists');
   *       }
   *       await tx.set(key, args);
   *     },
   *     async deleteTodo(tx: WriteTransaction, id: number) {
   *       ...
   *     },
   *   },
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * This will create the function to later use:
   *
   * ```ts
   * await rep.mutate.createTodo({
   *   id: 1234,
   *   title: 'Make things work offline',
   *   complete: true,
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * #### Replays
   *
   * *Mutators* run once when they are initially invoked, but they might also be
   * *replayed* multiple times during sync. As such *mutators* should not modify
   * application state directly. Also, it is important that the set of
   * registered mutator names only grows over time. If Replicache syncs and
   * needed *mutator* is not registered, it will substitute a no-op mutator, but
   * this might be a poor user experience.
   *
   * #### Server application
   *
   * During push, a description of each mutation is sent to the server's [push
   * endpoint](https://doc.replicache.dev/reference/server-push) where it is applied. Once
   * the *mutation* has been applied successfully, as indicated by the client
   * view's
   * [`lastMutationId`](https://doc.replicache.dev/reference/server-pull#lastmutationid)
   * field, the local version of the *mutation* is removed. See the [design
   * doc](https://doc.replicache.dev/design#commits) for additional details on
   * the sync protocol.
   *
   * #### Transactionality
   *
   * *Mutators* are atomic: all their changes are applied together, or none are.
   * Throwing an exception aborts the transaction. Otherwise, it is committed.
   * As with {@link query} and {@link subscribe} all reads will see a consistent view of
   * the cache while they run.
