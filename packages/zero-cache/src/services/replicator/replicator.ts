   * This is called by the View Syncer (via the View Notifier) when initiating a
   * session for a client, either from scratch or from an existing CVR, and when
   * its set of queries (and thus filters) changes.
   *
   * The Replicator ensures all filters are registered, returning the state versions
   * from which each filter has been active (i.e. used for populating the Invalidation
   * Index during replication).
   *
   * In the common case, the filters will have been registered in the past and all
   * versions will be older than the CVR version. However, it is possible for a spec's
   * `fromStateVersion` to be later than that of the CVR. This can happen because:
   *
   * 1. Old entries of the `InvalidationIndex` and `ChangeLog` are periodically pruned up to an
   *    "earliest version threshold" in order to manage storage usage. When this happens, the
   *   `fromStateVersion` entries of all older invalidation specs are bumped accordingly.
   *
   * 2. The `InvalidationRegistry` itself also goes through periodic cleanup whereby specs
   *    with a `lastRequested` time very far in the past are deleted to avoid unnecessary work.
   *    When the happens, requested specs may no longer be in the registry, and the Replicator
   *    will re-register them and return a (current) state version.
   *
   * Note that in both cases the CVR is very old and the queries are likely to be invalid
   * anyway. If the returned state version of a spec is later than that of the CVR, the
   * the associated queries must be considered invalidated and re-executed.
   *
   * @param req The {@link NormalizedInvalidationFilterSpec}s needed by the caller.
   * @returns The versions from which each filter has been active.
