/**
 * Expands the selection of a query to include all of the rows and column values
 * necessary to re-execute the query on the client, and aliases the columns so
 * that the result can be deconstructed into its constituent rows.
 *
 * ### Self Describing Aliases
 *
 * Given that a single result from JOIN query can include rows from multiple tables,
 * and even multiple rows from a single table in the case of self JOINs, a mechanism
 * for deconstructing the result is necessary to compute the views of the constituent
 * rows to send to the client.
 *
 * The format for aliasing columns is either of:
 *
 * ```
 *               {source-table}/{column-name}  // e.g. "users/id"
 * {subquery-id}/{source-table}/{column-name}  // e.g. "owner/users/id"
 * ```
 *
 * ### Simple Queries
 *
 * For simple queries, a selection must be expanded to include:
 * * The primary keys of the table in order to identify the row.
 * * The columns examined during the course of query execution,
 *    (e.g. `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, etc.).
 *
 * Logically:
 * ```sql
 * SELECT name FROM users WHERE level = 'superstar';
 * ```
 *
 * becomes:
 * ```sql
 * SELECT id AS "users/id",
 *        name AS "users/name",
 *        level AS "users/level"
 *   FROM users WHERE level = 'superstar';
 * ```
 *
 * Note that the returned field names include the source table and the column name,
 * obviating the need for the query result processor to inspect the query AST itself.
 *
 * ```
 *  users/id | users/name | users/level
 *  ---------+-------------------------
 *         1 | Alice      | superstar
 *         2 | Bob        | superstar
 * ```
 *
 * In case of a simple SELECT statement, no subquery id alias is needed.
 *
 * ### Simple table joins
 *
 * For simple join queries, this is expanded to also include:
 * * The columns referenced by the outer query, such as those used
 *   in the `ON` clause (or `SELECT`, `GROUP BY`, etc.).
 *
 * Logically:
 * ```sql
 * SELECT issues.title, owner.name
 *   FROM issues JOIN users AS owner ON issues.owner_id = owner.id;
 * ```
 *
 * becomes:
 * ```sql
 * SELECT issues.id           AS  "issues/id",
 *        issues.owner_id     AS  "issues/owner_id",
 *        issues.title        AS  "issues/title",
 *        owner."users/id"    AS  "owner/users/id",
 *        owner."users/name"  AS  "owner/users/name"
 *   FROM issues JOIN (
 *     SELECT id    AS  "users/id",
 *            name  AS  "users/name"
 *       FROM users)
 *   AS owner ON issues.owner_id = owner."users/id";
 * ```
 *
 * From this it becomes more apparent how the aliased column names are used to
 * deconstruct the result into constituent rows:
 *
 * ```
 *  issues/id | issues/owner_id | issues/title | owner/users/id | owner/users/name
 * -----------+-----------------+--------------+----------------+------------------
 *          1 |               1 | Foo issue    |              1 | Alice
 *          2 |               3 | Bar issue    |              3 | Candice
 * ```
 *
 * Also note that the columns from the JOIN'ed table have the subquery-id "owner", which
 * is the alias assigned to the JOIN statement. This allows distinguishing between rows
 * from different subqueries on the same table.
 *
 * ### Joins with queries
 *
 * For joins with subqueries, expanded selections from each nested query must be bubbled
 * up to the top level selection.
 *
 * Note, however, that the alias given to a subquery might not be unique at the top level
 * scope, as they only need to be unique within the scope of their subquery. For example,
 * in the query:
 *
 * ```sql
 * SELECT issues.title, owner.name FROM issues
 *   JOIN users AS owner ON owner.id = issues.user_id
 *   JOIN (SELECT issues.title AS parent_title, owner.name AS parent_owner_name
 *         FROM issues JOIN users AS owner ON owner.id = issues.user_id) AS parent
 *   ON parent.id = issues.parent_id;
 * ```
 *
 * both the top-level JOIN on the `users` table, and the nested JOIN on the `users`
 * within the `parent` subquery use the `owner` alias. Again, this is legal because the
 * latter is scoped within the inner subquery. When bubbling up its columns to the
 * higher level SELECT, the alias of the subquery is prepended with its containing JOIN
 * alias to eliminate the possibility of ambiguous names.
 *
 * ```sql
 * SELECT issues.id                  AS  "issues/id",
 *        issues.user_id             AS  "issues/user_id",
 *        issues.parent_id           AS  "issues/parent_id",
 *        issues.title               AS  "issues/title",
 *        owner."users/id"           AS  "owner/users/id",
 *        owner."users/name"         AS  "owner/users/name",
 *        parent."issues/id"         AS  "parent/issues/id",
 *        parent."issues/user_id"    AS  "parent/issues/user_id",
 *        parent."issues/title"      AS  "parent/issues/title",
 *        parent."owner/users/id"    AS  "parent/owner/users/id",
 *        parent."owner/users/name"  AS  "parent/owner/users/name"
 *   FROM issues
 *   JOIN (
 *         SELECT id    AS  "users/id",
 *                name  AS  "users/name"
 *         FROM users
 *        ) AS owner ON owner."users/id" = issues.user_id
 *   JOIN (
 *         SELECT issues.id           AS  "issues/id",
 *                issues.user_id      AS  "issues/user_id",
 *                issues.title        AS  "issues/title",
 *                owner."users/id"    AS  "owner/users/id",
 *                owner."users/name"  AS  "owner/users/name"
 *           FROM issues
 *           JOIN (
 *                 SELECT id    AS  "users/id",
 *                        name  AS  "users/name"
 *                 FROM users
 *                ) AS owner ON owner."users/id" = issues.user_id
 *        ) AS parent
 *   ON parent."issues/id" = issues.parent_id;

/**
 * The first step of full query expansion is sub-query expansion. In this step,

 * columns necessary to recompute the execution. In this step, column references are
 * plumbed downward into sub-queries; higher level `SELECT`, `ON`, etc. references to
 * columns from subqueries are passed down to the subqueries so that they can explicitly
 * SELECT them. Within each sub-query, its own AST is examined (`WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, etc.)
 * so that referenced columns are also surfaced in the selection.
 *
 * At the end of this step, all JOIN queries become sub-selects with explicit column
 * declarations. For example:
 *
 * ```sql
 * SELECT issues.title, owner.name
 *   FROM issues JOIN users AS owner ON issues.owner_id = owner.id
 *   WHERE issues.priority > 3;
