 * There are cases where an edit change gets split into a remove and/or an add
 * change.
 * 1. when the presence of the row in the result changes (for example the row
 *    is no longer present due to a filter)
 * 2. the edit results in the rows relationships changing
 *
 * If an edit is not split, the relationships of node and oldNode must
 * be the same, just the Row has changed.
 *
 * NOTE: It would be cleaner to just have the relationships once,
 * since they must be the same, however relationship Streams are single use
 * and if an Edit needs to be split into a remove and add a single map
 * of relationship Streams could not be used for the both the remove and
 * the add.  This cleanup could be done if we move to multi-use Streams
 * for relationships.
